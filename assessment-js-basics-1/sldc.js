// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = `This is the second step, which the goal is to determine what the application is expected to do and its requirements.`

const design = `This is the third step, and the goal is to model or outline the way the application will run.`

const Implementation = `This is the fourth step. The goal is to implement the above steps and start writing the code for the project. Sometimes called the development phase.`

const testingAndIntegration = `This is the fifth step, and the goal is to test/run the code to make sure everything is running smoothly before releasing it to the public.`

const maintain = `This is the sixth and final step. The goal here is to perform regular maintenance on the application to ensure it stays up to date and to solve any missed or future bugs that may arise.`
